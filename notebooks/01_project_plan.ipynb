    "## 1. Context: Role, Case Prompt, and Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "**Role context (GPA Lead / Senior Manager, BizOps – Global Portfolio Analysis)**\n",
    "- Challenge leadership to focus on the most consequential aspects of performance across 100+ metrics over 8+ years.\n",
    "- Build a ‘management by exception’ view: surface outliers, regime shifts, and blind spots rather than re‑stating dashboards.\n",
    "- Combine time‑series depth with business judgment: interpret *why* metrics move and what to do about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Case prompt (simplified)**\n",
    "- “Go find some publicly available data and show how Uber (or any other company) could make money from it.”\n",
    "- Use external, public data only (no internal Uber data).\n",
    "- Demonstrate: (i) structured thinking, (ii) smart use of time‑series analytics, and (iii) clear business storytelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "**My chosen angle**\n",
    "- Focus: **Uber airport trips in NYC** as a monetization and risk‑management opportunity.\n",
    "- Rationale:\n",
    "  - Airport pickups are high‑value, operationally critical trips (higher fares, time‑sensitive, peak congestion).\n",
    "  - Airports sit at the intersection of several rich public datasets: flights, weather, transit, and local mobility.\n",
    "  - This makes it a clean way to demonstrate how external signals can highlight **opportunities, risks, and blind spots**."

    "## 2. Project Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Use external public data** to approximate how Uber’s NYC airport business responds to exogenous signals\n",
    "   (weather, flight disruptions, transit outages).\n",
    "2. **Surface 2–3 concrete revenue or margin opportunities** and 1–2 risk flags that a GPA Lead could credibly bring\n",
    "   to Mobility leadership.\n",
    "3. **Demonstrate a scalable analytics pattern** that generalizes to the “100 metrics over 8 years” problem:\n",
    "   - Normalize and align heterogeneous time series.\n",
    "   - Quantify interdependencies (e.g., weather ↔ trips ↔ average fare).\n",
    "   - Prioritize ‘exceptions’ and structural breaks rather than reporting everything.\n",
    "4. Package the work so it is easy to discuss verbally in 30 minutes: a few clear charts + a simple narrative\n",
    "   about **signal → insight → action → $$**."

    "## 3. Business Questions & Working Hypotheses\n",
    "\n",
    "**Core question:**\n",
    "> How can Uber use public airport‑adjacent signals (flights, weather, transit) to improve pricing, supply positioning,\n",
    "> and reliability for NYC airport trips?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis 1 – Severe weather and demand spikes**\n",
    "- **H1a:** Severe weather at JFK/LGA/EWR (heavy rain, snow, low visibility) **increases demand** for airport trips\n",
    "  relative to similar non‑weather days.\n",
    "- **H1b:** On those days, **average fare per trip and ETAs** behave differently (e.g., higher fares, worse reliability),\n",
    "  creating an opportunity to better balance surge, incentives, and reliability guarantees.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis 2 – Flight volume & delays as advance signals**\n",
    "- **H2a:** Daily/hourly **flight arrivals and delay patterns** correlate strongly with airport ground trip demand.\n",
    "- **H2b:** Flight‑schedule + delay data could be used to **pre‑position drivers** before spikes (storm systems,\n",
    "  mass delays, diversion events), reducing surge volatility and cancellation rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis 3 – Transit disruptions and mode shift**\n",
    "- **H3a:** **MTA outages** or severe slowdowns on airport‑adjacent lines (e.g., E train to JFK, LIRR, AirTrain outages)\n",
    "  trigger **short‑notice uplifts in Uber trips** from key boroughs to the airports.\n",
    "- **H3b:** Uber could systematically treat transit alerts as a **‘demand shock’ prior** and use them to adjust\n",
    "  driver incentives and rider messaging (e.g., targeted notifications to likely airport riders).\n",
    "\n",
    "These hypotheses are intentionally simple but map directly to the GPA mandate:\n",
    "- They connect **external drivers → Uber performance metrics → monetizable actions**.\n",
    "- They set up a workflow that extends cleanly to many more metrics and cities."

    "\n",
    "The analysis will be structured to mirror what the GPA Lead would do when handed a large internal data stack:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.1 Phase 0 – Environment & repo structure (already done)\n",
    "- Confirm Python environment (Anaconda), Jupyter/Spyder, and Git are set up.\n",
    "- Repo layout (already created):\n",
    "  - `data/` – raw and processed external datasets.\n",
    "  - `notebooks/` – planning, EDA, and modeling notebooks.\n",
    "  - `code/` – reusable Python modules (data loading, feature engineering, plots).\n",
    "  - `reports/` – figures and final case slides.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.2 Phase 1 – Data ingestion and cleaning\n",
    "- Write loaders for each source (TLC, weather, flights, transit).\n",
    "- Standardize date/time handling and time zones.\n",
    "- Apply basic quality checks: missing values, outlier trip distances/fare amounts, duplicate flights, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.3 Phase 2 – Aggregation and feature engineering\n",
    "- Aggregate trip‑level data to daily (and, if manageable, hourly) airport metrics.\n",
    "- Construct external‑driver features and join into a **single time‑series panel** keyed by date (and airport).\n",
    "- Build a small library of transformations (lags, rolling averages, ratios).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.4 Phase 3 – EDA and interdependence\n",
    "- Visual EDA:\n",
    "  - Time‑series plots for trips, fares, and external drivers.\n",
    "  - Scatter/heatmaps: e.g., weather severity vs. trips, delays vs. trips per passenger.\n",
    "- Quantitative EDA:\n",
    "  - Correlation matrices (with and without lags).\n",
    "  - Simple baseline models: e.g., linear/regularized regression or gradient‑boosted trees to rank feature importance.\n",
    "  - Structural break / regime‑change diagnostics on key series.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.5 Phase 4 – Surface opportunities & risks\n",
    "- Define what counts as a **meaningful ‘exception’** (e.g., top 5% uplift or degradation vs. baseline).\n",
    "- For each hypothesis, identify:\n",
    "  - Conditions when performance materially improves (opportunity to **lean in**).\n",
    "  - Conditions when performance materially worsens (risk to **mitigate**).\n",
    "- Translate findings into potential levers:\n",
    "  - Pricing / surge tuning.\n",
    "  - Driver incentive design and pre‑positioning.\n",
    "  - Rider messaging (e.g., airport‑specific notifications).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.6 Phase 5 – Storyline and artifacts\n",
    "- Distill to **2–3 killer charts** + a one‑page narrative:\n",
    "  - “Here are the external signals that matter most for NYC airport performance.”\n",
    "  - “Here’s how much money we could unlock or protect by acting on them.”\n",
