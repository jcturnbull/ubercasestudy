Trying to integrate aviation-grade landing datasets introduces cost, complexity, engineering overhead, and time that provide minimal incremental signal for what you actually need to demonstrate to David.

You’re not being evaluated on airport-traffic domain expertise — you’re being evaluated on:

Structuring messy public data

Generating hypotheses

Measuring interdependencies

Identifying opportunities + risks from time-series evidence

Communicating constraints cleanly

Using TLC pickup counts near the airports as a proxy for airport arrivals is entirely valid and defensible.

How to frame this cleanly as a methodological limitation

You say (in your deck or verbal narrative):

“Ideally, I would merge hourly flight-arrival data for JFK/LGA to measure airport-driven rideshare demand.”

“However, high-resolution landing datasets are commercial (OAG, Cirium, FlightAware, FlightRadar24 BI) and have multi-day lead times and non-trivial cost.”

“Given the constraints of the exercise, I use TLC pickup volumes at airport-zone geographies as a proxy for airport traffic.”

“This proxy is appropriate for analyzing relative patterns — spikes, weather sensitivity, YoY changes — though it cannot disentangle landing volume from traveler mode choice.”

“I note this explicitly as a limitation in any causal interpretation.”

This reads mature, resource-aware, and pragmatic — exactly what BizOps leaders look for.

Why TLC pickups are a legitimate proxy (and you can defend it)

TLC HVFHV Pickup Location IDs include airport-designated zones.

These zones produce clear demand pulses aligned with flight schedules.

You are interested in how weather, disruptions, or seasonality influence rideshare demand originating from airports.

Even without knowing the exact number of aircraft landings, the pickup volume reflects realized ground-transport demand, which is what Uber cares about.

Airport arrivals → ground demand → HVFHV pickup counts
